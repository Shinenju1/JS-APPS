#RULES
-  There are two players that roll dices in turns
-  Each player can roll as many dices as they want in a single turn, and the score gets summed up in a temporary score counter.
- If a player rolls a 1, the temporary score counter resets back to 0 and the turn ends.
- A player can decide to stop the round by pressing the "HOLD" button, turning their temporary score into permanent score.
- The first player that reaches 100 total points wins.
